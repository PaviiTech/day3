This project focuses on mastering the foundational concepts of data retrieval using SQL by executing basic SELECT queries on a well-structured Library Management Database. The schema includes tables such as Author, Publisher, Book, Member, and Loan, designed with proper primary and foreign key relationships. The queries practiced in this project cover essential SQL clauses including SELECT, WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN, ORDER BY, and LIMIT. These allow users to extract specific columns, filter data using conditions, search patterns, and sort or limit the result set. This exercise is aimed at building confidence in querying real-world databases and helps lay a solid foundation for more advanced SQL concepts like joins and aggregations. By working through these queries, learners will understand how to access and manipulate relational data efficiently for reporting and analysis.
